# JavaScript API Quiz

This homework was to make a short quiz in JavaScript. The functionality was supposed to include a button to start the game (make the quiz show), start the timer and hide the homepage.

Correct answers need to give the user points. Incorrect answers deduct time.

User score was to be saved in local storage and displayed when the highscore button had been pressed.

## What I accomplished

I started by laying out what I had wanted my quiz to look like on HTML and CSS. 

Once I had those made, I created two JavaScript files. One to hold my quiz, and the other to hold my answers variable.

I then laid out a framework with comments of each function I needed and filled them in from there.

I incorporated Bootstrap into my code to make styling and positioning elements easier.

My start button starts the timer, hides the homepage and displays the quiz.

The quiz does not work as I intended it to. The choices for the questions will not populate the <li> buttons they are attached to with variables in JS.

My back button works and brings you back to the homepage to start playing again.

I have all local storage set up to save user scores.

I have eventListeners for all buttons that would be displayed to the user.

I have all the functions used laid out in order and their descriptions commented above them.

The quiz is fully functional thanks to help from my tutor.
